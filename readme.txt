This assignment was part of the course CS F320 - Foundations of Data Science.

In this assignment, we performed data preprocessing and analysis on a univariate dataset. We then continued to implement linear regression(gradient descent) manually using only numpy arrays without using any inbuilt libraries. 

We then performed polynomial regression on this dataset and used the concept of bias-variance trade-off to find out the best degree polynomial and best value of regularisation parameter.

Since the perfect bias and variance values cannot be measured, we have used few heuristics to judge the value of both bias and variance present in the model.
